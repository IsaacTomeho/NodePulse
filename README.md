# NodePulse
Final Project for CS160 - Clark University (Fall 2023)

This is a final project for my Algorithms class in which Milgram's Six Degrees of Separation is simulated using
a Graph in which classmates are nodes and their connection as friends are edges. The simulation uses BFS to
determine the shortest path from an origin node to the destination node. It then highlights the nodes which lead
to the small degrees of separation from origin to destination; or displays "No Solution Found" if there is no path
from origin to destination. 

## How To Use
src - run App.js 
origin text field - "node_name"
destination text field - "node_name"
